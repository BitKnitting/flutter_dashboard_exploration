# flutter_dashboard_exploration

In this project I explored making a dashboard using the techniques taught by whatsupcoder in her [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEVOiv_j35w) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABbBYebnwDQ&t=311s) Dashboard videos.  She uses the StaggereddGridView.  I think it looks very nice.
